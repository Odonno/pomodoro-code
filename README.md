## Commands

There is a list of commands you can use in VS Code :

* Start Pomodoro
    * Start a new Pomodoro
* Stop Pomodoro
    * Pause the current Pomodoro and wait
* Reset Pomodoro
    * Stop the existing Pomodoro and wait to start with a fresh new one
* Configure Pomodoro
    * Open `config.json` file to update the configuration of Pomodoro

## Status Bar

The status bar contains the current timer of your Pomodoro. 
It also contains buttons to start or stop Pomodoro.

## Alerts

When Work/Pause timer is over, it alerts you by showing you a pop-up.

## Configuration file

The configuration file is a simple json object contained in `config.json`. 
It will provide you a way to change Pomodoro as you want, see an example :

```
{
	"work": 25,
	"pause": 5	
}
```
